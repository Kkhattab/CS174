#Setup 
---

1. Drag HW4 folder into Apache document root. 

2. Navigate inside HW4 direcotry and from the command line enter the following command `php CreateDB.php`. The database, & table will be created for you with this script.

3. You should be at the landing page and have the ability to enter data. Here is some dummy data for you to paste into the text area and share:

```
Jan, 500, 50
Feb, 600, 80
March, 300, 40
April, 780, 25 
June, 760, 55
July, 360, 38 
```

4. If you enter data in an incorrect format, proper validation will be thrown. 

*Our git log was to big to submit because we have all previous homeworks in one repo. We have attached screen shots of our github repo instead*
