001. h1 heading PasteChart
002. Beneath h1 should be subheading, "Share your data in charts!"
003. Underneath sub heading text field with label, "Chart Title”
004. Then a large text area under which is a Share button.
005. Place holder for the text area should say the allowed format for the data: 
	The data format should be a comma separated list of values, one per line, up to 50 lines of at most 80 characters, these will represent the points to plot our data. 
006. The first coordinate should represent a text label, can be numbers but no commas

		Feb, 450, 5.0 
		March, 551, 4.9
007. On every row, the first coordinate must be a nonempty string, however, for the remaining coordinates if a value is missing, we represent that with the empty string. For example:
Aug,,10.1
008. When user clicks share button your app should check the data matches the format indicated above. 
009. Write a few unit tests that check the data when being sent server side. 
010. If error in the data a alert should be displayed. 
011. If data does match format, the data should be md5 hashed using PHPs hash function. http://php.net/manual/en/function.hash.php and then should be stored in database table. 
012. Let XXXXXX represent the character in the md5 hash, then the page should draw a page with title and h1 heading “XXXXX Line Graph - PasteChart”. Beneath this should be a line graph with title the user gave and the data provided by user. 
013.  Define a constant BASE_URL in your config.php script as the url of your website. This page should then have the lines (in p or div or pre or other tags of your choice):
